### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's me, Cobalt.  
I'm currently looking into Docker and Linux containers  
I also like to play with servers and shit  

Here's my setup specs, for those who want to see  

## Main Computer Specs  

CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 3100 4c/8t @ 3.6GHz  
RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3200  
Int. Storage: 256GB Verbatim Vi550 S3 SSD + 1TB Toshiba P110 HDD  

Motherboard: Asrock A320M-HDV R4.0  
Graphics: Asus Dual Mini GeForce GTX 1650 OC 4GB GDDR6  
Case: CiT Tornado RGB  
OS: Windows 10 Pro 20H2  

Well, that's it for my main PC  
Let's move onto the servers, shall we?  

## Server Specs  

### Cobalt-SRV

I bought this server not long ago (May 11th), and I've had some trouble with it for its first day or so*, but we're up and running now.  
It's an old HP-Compaq Elite 8200 SFF PC from 2011.

CPU: Intel Core i5-2400 4c/4t @ 3.4GHz  
RAM: 8GB DDR3-1333 (unknown brand)  
Int. Storage: 256GB Kingston KC600 SATA3 SSD + 250GB WD Caviar Blue HDD  
Ext. Storage: 2TB Toshiba Canvio Basics USB 3.0 HDD  
Motherboard: HP PCEBK0ED64N6J1 656933-001 (Intel Q67 Express chipset)  
Networking: Gigabit Ethernet  
OS: OpenMediaVault v5.6.7-1 (Usul) (based on Debian stable)  
Price: Â£70 + Â£12 for USB card = Â£82  

\*It originally came with a SanDisk Pulse 64GB SSD with Windows 10 installed, which actually turned out to be dead.  
  (I was getting SMART errors on boot and BSODs, so I had to do with the 250GB HDD on day one.)

### Web server (no assigned hostname, using Hetzner default)

This is simply just used as a host for the [Cobalt Online website](https://cobaltonline.ml)  
It's a Hetzner CX11 VPS, costing just Â£2.58 a month for the following resources.  

CPU: Intel Xeon Skylake (1 vCPU @ 2.25GHz)  
RAM: 2GB DDR4 (unknown)  
Storage: 20GB NVMe SSD  
Networking: 10 Gigabit Ethernet  
OS: Debian GNU/Linux 10.9 (Buster)  

Well, that was a rundown of my specs I guess
